Finding application script is not available for AIX. I never got full access to test on AIX servers. However, you can still use the linux application script or solaris application script. In theory they should both work, but it is not tested yet. Refer to documentation if you have other questions.  

Also please place the two scripts in two different directories. Ex: Put process script in folder 1 and application script in folder 2, the report files will be exported in their respective
directories
